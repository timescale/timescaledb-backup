// Compression jobs (or any other sort of job that performs DDL on a chunk such as
// reorder) running at the wrong time can cause deadlocks in the following way: 1)
// compression job takes write lock & main dump process takes read lock (no conflict) 2)
// compression job requests exclusive lock (waits on main dump process) 3) child dump
// process requests read lock (waits on compression process). Essentially, any concurrent
// DDL operation could cause this problem, but the user can put off DDL, but this is
// harder with scheduled operations like compression jobs.

// The simple solution would seem to be pausing jobs while we are doing the dump and
// resuming them when we've finished. Unfortunately, a full pause is problematic as, if
// the dump process were to crash, you'd end up with your jobs in a state where they would
// never run. In order to avoid that, we instead create a process that checks for
// problematic jobs scheduled to start in the next ten minutes and moves them into the
// future by 15-20 minutes. This way, if the dump process crashes, the worst that can
// happen is that your job is put off by 20 minutes. We also keep track of any jobs we
// rescheduled and try to put them back on schedule when we finish the dump.

//JobMover moves compression or any DDL performing jobs in the database specified by
//dbURI, it is meant to be run in a separate goroutine and will also signal via
//jobsStopped channel that these jobs have stopped. It will stop if it is told to on the
//cleanup channel. The waitgroup wg is for coordinating cleanup. pauseUDAs specifies
//whether we should pause user-defined actions in Timescale 2+ and verbose controls how
//much information we print about what's going on.
